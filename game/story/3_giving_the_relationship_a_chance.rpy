    Icarus, or at least that's how you can call him, didn't explain a lot but you've already let your intuition decide what to do about him before your mind really does. 

    If all he feels compelled to do are paper cranes and no single thing or motivation about his previous life,  he's rendered harmless. no reason to go against you.

    Seems like he's already getting used to being in this room, which renders you uneasy.

    You'd rather have him stay elsewhere, somewhere he doesn't interrupt as you deal with boxes, furniture, or electronics.

    ILORA "Icarus?"

    "He eyes you with curiosity, slightly uncertain."

    ICARUS "Yes?"

    ILORA "Do you mind moving to the other room?"

    "He looks down."

    ICARUS "Umm, yes, sure."

    ILORA "It's just I don't want to accidentally hit you with a racket as I'm moving around or something."

    "He looks up at you again, eyes lit up."

    ICARUS "Don't worry about that! I can stay fully eh… abstract."

    ICARUS "And– And I can even help you if not. My grain of salt for sharing the apartment?"

    ILORA "Sharing?"

    "He's planning on staying? Well, thinking again, he was probably here before you were."

    ICARUS "I'm sorry I can't help you with the rent. I heard the landowner talk about prices the other day. It sounds complicated."

    "You shake your head."

    ILORA "I've been to many places and this is the least problematic one I've stayed in so far. Besides, I already paid for this place."

    "You're not sure what having \"paid\" for this condo means to him, but his face illuminates. "

    ICARUS "Does that mean we're… roommates?"

    ILORA "Hey, I don't really know you so…"

    "The sight of him is pitiful as the color seems to drain out of him the longer you go on."

    ILORA "I'll think about it."

    "He smiles."

    ICARUS "[ILORA.name], would you like me to help you unpack your things?"

    ILORA "Hmm…"

    "He is serious about trying to be helpful."

    "But your things are your things, and you are not willing to sacrifice a single bit of your privacy."

    ILORA "Thanks, but I'm alright."

    "You don't miss how his smile dulls despite remaining intact, yet you motion towards the doorway. He silently follows– Bang."

    ICARUS "Ouch…"

    "Confused, you watch him rub his forehead."

    ILORA "???"

    "He smiles sheepishly."

    ICARUS "It seems like I can't go through it."

    ILORA "You… You did open the door, right?"

    ICARUS "Of course! Even if I didn't, I'm a ghost."

    "And that is why you cannot not think he's messing with you."

    ILORA "What about the window?"

    "He gently presses his hand against an invisible wall where the way out the window is supposed to be."

    ILORA "Ugh…"

    ILORA "Balcony?"

    "Obediently, he slides towards the balcony, an arm outstretched before he hits his face. However, he never hits a surface. He looks surprised as he turns around and looks at you from the balcony."

    ICARUS "It's been a while since I had fresh air…"

    ILORA "Perfect then."

    "You follow him out, and nod to yourself as you look at the grand sky."

    ILORA "You can fly off from here."

    ICARUS "Huh?"

    ILORA "Or can drop down a few floors if flying and potentially bumping with a bird isn't your thing."

    ICARUS "WHAT?"

    ILORA "What?"

    ICARUS "I– I…"

    "He trails off as he stares down at the street that's far below us."

    ICARUS "I'm sorry, I can't."

    "He steps back."

    ILORA "But you're a ghost! Nothing's gonna happen to you."

    ICARUS "I– I know…"

    You don't want to confront him again, but he's being completely irrational. 

    Is he… afraid of heights? Trauma? Well, he certainly doesn't have head trauma from a fall; his ghost form looks perfectly unharmed. Yet the fact he won't come down remains.

    He's trapped in this condo room, and you're trapped with him.

    Wordlessly, you go back inside and he follows like a pup.

    You wonder why he's stuck here, but if superstition is worth anything maybe he's doing his penance. 

    With his gentle appearance and slightly awkward disposition, what sort of regrets could he have heavy enough to ground him to this place? 

    His sole passtime seems to be making paper cranes, or that's the only thing you've seen him do one time or another. The art piece lies right where you left it, and you contemplate as you pick it up.

    ICARUS "I don't know."

    ICARUS "I… don't remember."

    ILORA "I see…"

    "You smile faintly at the pretty origami in your hand, recalling a certain custom."

    ILORA "You know, somewhere in Japan, there's a myth about cranes."

    ICARUS "Like this one?"

    "By the attentiveness in his expression you know he wants to hear about it."

    ILORA "Senbazuru. One person or a group makes one thousand paper cranes in a year and by the end of it whispers a wish. Once it's done, what they hope for will become true."

    ILORA "That's what they say anyway…"

    "Whatever skepticism you were about to express, even if light, remains unsaid as you trail off. Icarus straightens his posture, eyes gleaming with resolve." 

    ICARUS "I'll do it."

    ILORA "Do what?"

    ICARUS "The thousand cranes!"

    ILORA "Now of all times? Haven't you had the chance to make more than a few?"

    ICARUS "I think…"

    "He counts with his fingers, not even reaching the tenth number."

    ICARUS "I think I made lots before, but they went missing, or at least I don't know where they all went."

    "He had a wish before?"

    ILORA "You did something similar? What was your wish then?"

    "He laughs, nervous."

    ICARUS "To move on I suppose? It's the most reasonable thing I could think of… ha, ha!"
